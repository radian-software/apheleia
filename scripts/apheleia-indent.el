;; This file has code that is evaluated in CI before the indentation
;; of apheleia.el is checked. This is helpful because it allows us to
;; ensure that various things are indented correctly if they require
;; some setup for Emacs to know how to do the right thing.

;; Nothing here yet though! ^_^

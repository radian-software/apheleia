;; `apheleia' core library.

;; This file contains the core of `apheleia'. This includes `apheleia-mode',
;; utility functions for calling formatters based on `apheleia-formatters'
;; and hooks to reformat the current buffer while minimising the displacement
;; to `point'.

Must accept arbitrary keyword arguments. The following arguments

`:formatter' - The symbol for the formatter that was run.

`:error' - Non-nil if the formatter failed, nil if it succeeded.

`:log' - The log buffer for that formatter, or nil if there is
none (e.g., because logging is not enabled).

This hook is run before `apheleia-after-format-hook', and may be
run multiple times if `apheleia-mode-alist' configures multiple

Set to `cancel' to immediately fail whenever you try to format a remote

Set to `remote' to make apheleia spawn the process and any other temporary
files on the same remote machine the buffer is on. Note due to restrictions
with `tramp' when this option is set `apheleia' will run any formatters
synchronously, meaning Emacs will block until formatting the buffer finishes.
For more information see:
https://www.mail-archive.com/tramp-devel@gnu.org/msg05623.html

Set to `local' to make `apheleia' run the formatter on the current machine
and then write the formatted output back to the remote machine. Note some
features of `apheleia' (such as `file' in `apheleia-formatters') is not
compatible with this option and formatters relying on them will crash."

  "Wrapper for `make-process' that behaves a bit more nicely.
COMMAND is as in `make-process'. STDIN, if given, is a buffer
whose contents are fed to the process on stdin. CALLBACK is
invoked with one argument, the buffer containing the text from
stdout, when the process terminates (if it succeeds). ENSURE is a
callback that's invoked whether the process exited sucessfully or
not. EXIT-STATUS is a function which is called with the exit
status of the command; it should return non-nil to indicate that
the command succeeded. If EXIT-STATUS is omitted, then the
command succeeds provided that its exit status is 0. FORMATTER is
the symbol of the formatter that is being run, for diagnostic
purposes. FORMATTER is nil if the command being run does not
correspond to a formatter. REMOTE if non-nil will use the
formatter buffers file-handler, allowing the process to be
spawned on remote machines."

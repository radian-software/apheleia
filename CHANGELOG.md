# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog].

## Unreleased
## Features
* Allow apheleia to format buffers without an underlying file ([#52]).
* Support functional formatters ([#62]). You can now use a lisp
  function as a formatter allowing you to plug more powerful
  formatters into apheleia such as language servers.

## Bugs fixed
* Allow running the same formatter in multiple buffers in parallel
  ([#64], [#65]). Previously, when saving a number of files at the
  same time, the contents of those buffers could be corrupted by a
  race condition.
* In some circumstances the error `wrong-type-argument bufferp nil`
  could be reported when running certain formatters under Apheleia.
  This has been fixed.

## 1.2 (released 2021-12-27)
### Enhancements
* Support multiple formatters ([#31]). You can now configure a list of
  formatters for a major-mode in `apheleia-mode-alist` and they will
  be run in sequence.
* Support evaluating items in `apheleia-formatters` to make formatter
  commands more dynamic ([#50], [#55]).
* Allow apheleia to format buffers without an underlying file ([#52]).

### Formatters
* [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) for
  C/C++
* [`google-java-format`](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)
  for Java
* [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for
  [Python](https://www.python.org/) ([#51])
* [latexindent](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexindent?lang=en) for
  [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
* [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) for
  [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ([#24])
* [`mix format`](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.12/Mix.Tasks.Format.html)
  for Elixir ([#48])
* [`@prettier/plugin-ruby`](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-ruby)
  for Ruby ([#49])

### Bugs fixed
* Fix spelling error in generated process names ([#32]).
* Apheleia no longer conflicts with undo-fu ([#39]).
* Apheleia no longer triggers `after-set-visited-file-name-hook`,
  which reduces conflicts with various modes. For example, `lsp-mode`
  will no longer trigger a reconnect every time you save.
* Fix inconsistent `:type` spec preventing use of `customize-variable`
  on `apheleia-formatters`.
* Fix mixed style line ending generated by `diff` ([#54]) by adding
  `--strip-trailing-cr` to `diff`'s argument list.

## 1.1.2 (released 2021-02-26)
### Enhancements
* Prettier is now enabled in `json-mode`.

### Bugs fixed
* Prettier now respects `.prettierignore` ([#21]).
* Apheleia's global mode should no longer trigger warnings about a locally
  let-bound `after-save-hook` ([#27]).

[#27]: https://github.com/raxod502/apheleia/issues/27

## 1.1.1 (released 2020-07-16)
### Formatters
* New: [OCamlFormat](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat) for
  [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/) ([#19]).

### Bugs fixed
* Previously, there were some race conditions related to switching the
  current buffer. In particular, if you switched the current buffer
  right after saving, or save two buffers in quick succession, then it
  was possible for one buffer to be overwritten or to not be
  formatted. These problems have been fixed ([#8]).
* Previously, enabling `undo-tree-auto-save-history` caused Apheleia
  to mark the buffer as modified after formatting. This has been
  fixed ([#10]).
* Apheleia now tries harder to accidentally enter an infinite
  formatting loop ([#12]).

## 1.1 (released 2020-04-02)
### Enhancements
* There is now a maximum length for the dynamic programming algorithm,
  controlled by `apheleia-max-alignment-size`. This prevents Emacs
  from hanging due to Apheleia. under any circumstances ([#4]).

### Formatters
* New: [Brittany](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brittany) for
  [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

### Bugs fixed
* Previously, weirdness could happen if manually running Prettier via
  `M-x apheleia-format-buffer` on a buffer which was modified from
  what was written to disk. Now we simply abort running a command that
  uses the `file` keyword if the buffer is modified, since it will not
  produce correct results. This should not affect normal usage of
  Apheleia.
* Previously, the buffer could be erased when running Apheleia from a
  buffer that had no backing file. This has been fixed, and Apheleia
  can run correctly on buffers both with and without backing files
  ([#9]).

is a symbol that can help in filtering the resulting log output.
MESSAGE and ARGS are interpreted as in `message', except that any
of ARGS can also be a function of no arguments which will be
invoked to get the real value. This is helpful because the
function won't be evaluated if logging is disabled. Only lambda
functions are accepted, to avoid symbols being interpreted as
callables by accident."
